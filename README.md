# WX
WX is a weather application I developed using ReactJS,
leveraging the OpenWeather API. The application offers users detailed
insights into current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily
predictions. Based on the current weather conditions, the background changes
reflecting real-time weather scenarios. The tech stack utilized for this
project included ReactJS as the core framework for building the
application's frontend. SCSS was employed for styling, ensuring a
modern and responsive design across various devices and screen sizes.
Axios served as the HTTP client for seamless communication with the
OpenWeather API, ensuring timely and accurate data retrieval. Please note that this project was designed exclusively for mobile screens.
